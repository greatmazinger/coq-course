# Syllabus

* Everyone presents at least one topic and prepares exercises for it.
* If you want to present some topic, write your name in the presenter column!

  - You are encouraged to pick topics that you find of interest, even if they are not currently in the syllabus.

  - If the topic is new, add your name and the title to the end of the table.
    We can agree on a date and make space for your presentation during the next session.

  - You can find many suggestions for topics in [suggestions.md](/suggestions.md).

An overall goal is to get to "[Normalization of STλC](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/Norm.html)", but, depending on the topics that presenters pick and timing constraints, we might stop somewhere along the way. This will require going through the "[STλC](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/Stlc.html)" and perhaps "[STλCProp](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/StlcProp.html)".

Presenters are *not* discouraged from picking other, unrelated topics. Once they have chosen a topic, they are encouraged to give examples or exercises related to the overall goal, if possible.
